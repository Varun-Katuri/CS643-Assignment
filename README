--Aws steps
Need to setup the cloud environment and run this application in the cloud on 2 EC2s, connect through sqs
Connect rekognition, and S3 bucket(the images are stored)
follow the below steps.

--IAM Setup
Navigate to "IAM" -> "Access Management" -> "Policies".  Give full access to the following three policies and Create the profile

	AmazonRekognitionFullAccess
	AmazonS3FullAccess
	AmazonSQSFullAccess

--EC2 Setup [Perform for EC2_A and EC2_B]
click on "Services" -> "EC2"
click on "Instances" in the drop down  Section 
click on "Launch Instances" -> "Launch Instances" 
Select the "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-0b0af3577fe5e3532"  
Select the "t2.micro type (Free tier eligible)" 
click "Next: Configure Instance Details"
	Ensure "Number of instances" is "1"
click "Next: Add Storage"
click "Next: Add Tags"
	Insert "EC2_A" under "Key" and "Value"
click "Next: Configure Security Group"
	Click "Add Rule" to include the following and it will autofill:
	SSH, HTTP, HTTPS
	Under 'Source' drop down for each rule, select 'My IP'
click "Review and Launch"
	Click on "Launch" after reviewing your information

--Run the following command to set the correct permissions for the .pem file:
	$ chmod labsuser.pem

--Connect to your EC2 instances (after they have started running), 
To connect, run the following command in your terminal (replacing <YOUR_EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS> with 
the "Public IPv4 DNS" attribute of either EC2 instance):
	$ ssh -i “~/labsuser.pem" ec2-user@<YOUR_EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IPV4_ADDRESS>
After you have connected, run the following commands to update Java from 1.7 to 1.8 on the EC2:
	$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0-devel
	$ sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --config java
Upon running the second command, you should enter the number that corresponds to 
	java-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64 (/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.322.b06-2.el8_5.x86_64/jre/bin/java)
	**You will need to complete this step on BOTH EC2's.
	
--Credentials Setup [Access and Secret Keys]
	Click on "Services" -> "IAM"
	On the left tab side, under "Access Management" -> "Users"
	Click on user created (e.g. varunkaturi)
	Open the "Security credentials" tab, and then choose "Create access key"
	To find out the new access key, choose "Show". Your credentials resemble the following:
		Access key ID: JOHIHIACSCKNSCNHOSACNKAN
		Secret access key: 56uha899abkj09sajhikjjasjjnjnask=-asbc
	To download the key pair, choose 'Download .csv' file. 
	Store the .csv file with keys in a secure location.

--SSH into both EC2's that you created in the previous step, and on each 
one, create a file:
	$mkdir .aws
	$touch .aws/credentials
	$vi .aws/credentials
	**Paste those copied credentials into the credential file on each EC2 as follows:
	[default]
	aws_access_key_id= THI5I5NOTTH3ACCE55K3Y  
	aws_secret_access_key= THI5I5NOTTH3S3CR3TACCE55K3Y
	**Note: You will need to re-copy and paste these credentials onto both EC2's whenever 
	they change (after your session ends).

--Running the application
the terminal of your local machine, run the  commands to retrieve the GitHub Repository of the JAR files to be used for the 2 EC2 Instances.
	$ git clone https://github.com/Varun-Katuri/CS643-Assignment.git

--SSH into EC2-B and run the following command:
	$ java -jar CS643-Assignment/CarText/CarText.jar
	**This will begin running the code for text recognition. However, since it depends on items in the SQS queue 
	to process, it will simply wait until we begin running the car recognition code. To begin running the car 
	recognition code. 
--SSH into EC2-A and run the following command:
	$ java -jar CS643-Assignment/CarRecognize/CarRecognize.jar
Now, both programs will be running simultaneously. The program for  EC2-A is processing images in the S3 bucket (njit-cs-643) and sending the indexes of images to
include cars to EC2-B through SQS, which  is processing the images and showing which ones include text as well. once both programs have finished running, 
you will find a file named output.txt on EC2-B in the home directory. This output file will display the indexes of images that contained both cars and text, along with the 
associated text from each image.
